1. Problem Modeled

You’re trying to mimic Google Docs-like editor in a simple way:

A Document consists of multiple elements (Text, Image, NewLine, TabSpace).

A DocumentEditor allows users to add elements, render the document, and save it.

Different storage strategies (FileStorage, DBStorage) decide where to save the document.

2. Key OOD/LLD Principles Used
✅ Abstraction

DocumentElement is an abstract class with render().
→ It hides the details of how text, image, newline, etc., are represented.

Persistence is another abstract class with save().
→ It hides the details of saving (file vs DB).

✅ Inheritance (IS-A)

TextElement, ImageElement, NewLineElement, TabSpaceElement all inherit from DocumentElement.
→ They override render() to define their own rendering behavior.

FileStorage and DBStorage inherit from Persistence and implement save() differently.

✅ Polymorphism

When iterating over documentElements, the program calls ele->render().
→ Based on the actual object type (TextElement, ImageElement), the correct function runs.

Same for storage: storage->save() could call File saving or DB saving depending on which object is passed.

✅ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

DocumentElement hierarchy: deals only with representing different document parts.

Document: only maintains and renders elements.

Persistence: only responsible for saving data.

DocumentEditor: acts as a facade to connect everything (editing + saving).

Each class has a clear single responsibility.

✅ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

You can add new elements (like TableElement, HeaderElement) without changing existing code—just extend DocumentElement.

You can add new saving strategies (like CloudStorage) by extending Persistence.

Your system is open for extension, closed for modification.

✅ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

DocumentEditor depends on the abstraction Persistence, not a specific implementation.
→ You can swap FileStorage with DBStorage without modifying DocumentEditor.

3. Class Relationships

Composition: Document has-a collection of DocumentElement*.

Aggregation: DocumentEditor has a Document and a Persistence.

Strategy Pattern: Persistence implementations define different saving strategies.

So, this design demonstrates Composite + Strategy Pattern ideas.

4. Flow of Usage

User interacts with DocumentEditor.

DocumentEditor adds different DocumentElement objects to Document.

Document renders all elements into a single string using polymorphism.

DocumentEditor calls Persistence->save() to persist the document.

5. Improvements for Future

Use smart pointers (unique_ptr / shared_ptr) → Avoid memory leaks.

Apply Builder Pattern for creating complex documents.

Add Undo/Redo functionality → Use Command Pattern.

Use Factory Pattern for creating DocumentElements dynamically.

📝 One-Line Takeaway

This code is a mini LLD for a Document Editor that shows:

Abstraction + Polymorphism for document parts and saving strategies,

SRP, OCP, DIP from SOLID,

and a hint of Strategy + Composite Pattern.

👉 Next time you read the code, think like this:

Document = data structure (Composite).

Elements = polymorphic components (Abstraction).

Persistence = strategy for saving (Strategy Pattern).

Editor = Facade/Orchestrator.
